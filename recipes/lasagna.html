    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna (or lasagne) is a classic Italian dish made of stacked layers of wide, flat pasta sheets, alternating with fillings such as a rich meat sauce (ragù or bolognese), cheese (ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and other ingredients like vegetables or béchamel sauce. The dish is typically baked in an oven until golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Sauce</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Aromatics/Flavor</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook ground meat and/or sausage with aromatics, then simmer with tomatoes and seasonings until thickened.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta (or cottage cheese), eggs, Parmesan, and herbs in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Alternate layers of pasta sheets, sauce, and the cheese mixture, finishing with a final layer of pasta topped with sauce and mozzarella/Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for a period (usually around 45 minutes), then uncover and bake until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing to help the layers set and prevent a watery result.</li>
        </ol>
