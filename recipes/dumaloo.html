    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>To a pressure cooker add around 35-40 baby potatoes with water till immersing level along with required salt. Pressure cook for 1-2 whistles. Switch off. Let the pressure release by itself. Then open, strain and remove the baby potatoes. Cool them down first. Peel off the skin from the baby potatoes.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Prick each potato with a fork, prick randomly. This is for the gravy to blend well inside also.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Heat 2 tablespoon oil add the cooked baby potatoes and saute for a minute. Now add salt to taste along with 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder and 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder. Fry until it is roasted well. Remove to a bowl and set aside.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Now add 2 medium sized onion(sliced) to the same pan and saute until transparent. Add 4 medium sized tomatoes(roughly chopped) to it. Saute until tomatoes turn mushy and raw smell of tomatoes leave. Add 10 whole cashews to it give a quick mix and switch off. Transfer to a bowl and cool down completely. Grind to a fine paste along with little water and set it aside.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Now to the same pan add 1 tablespoon oil and heat it â€“ add one 1/2 inch cinnamon, 2 cloves and 2 cardamom. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds let it splutter then add ginger garlic paste. Saute for a minute. Add onion tomato paste. Rinse the mixer with water and add it around 3/4 cup. Mix it well and let it boil for few minutes.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Now add salt to taste along with 1.5 teaspoon red chili powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder and 3/4 teaspoon garam masala powder. Give a quick mix. Whisk 3/4 cup thick curd and add it. Keep stirring continuously to avoid curd from curdling. Now add salt if needed along with fried baby potatoes. Give a quick mix. Add water if needed to adjust consistency. </h3></li>
        <li><h3>Dum cook for 10-12 minutes. My lid is heavy so closed it as such and cooked. Alternatively you can place the pan on dosa tawa and close with tight heavy lid so that no steam escapes. This is called dum cooking. After 10 minutes open and add 1 tablespoon coriander leaves along with 1 teaspoon crushed kasoori methi. Give a quick mix and your creamy Dum Aloo is ready!</h3></li>
    </ol>
