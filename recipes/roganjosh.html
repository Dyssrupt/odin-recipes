    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><h3><strong>Rogan josh</strong>, also spelled <strong>roghan josh</strong> or <strong>roghan ghosht</strong>, is an aromatic curried meat dish originating from Kashmir.</h3></p>
    <p><h3>It is made with red meat—traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat—and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.</h3></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lamb</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Ghee (or butter)</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Chilli</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Fennel</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Cardamom</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Put a pressure cooker and heat ghee in it. When the ghee is hot enough, add the whole spices and fry for a few seconds.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Then, add whole red chillies and cumin seeds in the pressure cooker and fry for a few seconds. Afterwards, add the mutton pieces in it and stir well. Cover with the lid but don’t close it and cook the mutton for 5-6 minutes on medium to high flame. You will notice the meat will turn light brown in colour. After 5 minutes, remove the lid and add 1/2 cup of water in it and stir well with the spices. This will help the mutton in soaking the flavours of all the spices. Then, lower the flame and cook the mutton for 10-15 minutes.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Meanwhile, take a small bowl and add all-purpose flour along with yoghurt in it, mix well. In this yoghurt mixture, add salt, fennel powder, coriander powder, Kashmiri red chilli powder and dry ginger powder (sonth powder). Mix all the spices well in the yoghurt. Once done, add into the pressure cooker. Stir well using a ladle and cook the mutton in yoghurt for at least a minute.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Then, add 1 cup of water in the pressure cooker and slow cook the mutton for 1-2 hours. Stir in between so that it doesn’t stick to the bottom. You can also pressure cook the mutton for 5-6 whistles. Once done, garnish and serve hot with chapati or naan. You can also enjoy this dish with rice.</h3></li>
